    "BMI is a simple, inexpensive, and common measure for body fat. However, there are several clinical considerations to keep in mind when using this measure. It's critical to keep in mind BMI is only a surrogate measure since it uses weight instead of actual body fat content in its calculations. Below are three examples of factors that can influence BMI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: older adults usually have more body fat than younger adults for the same BMI\n",
    "- Gender: women tend to have greater amounts of body fat compared to men for the same BMI\n",
    "- Muscle mass: muscular individuals or athletes may have higher BMI due to increased muscle mass\n",
